Udacity-859-Python
==================

Python version of the Udacity Scalable Apps course project.

Updates:
========

2 August 2014:
- Putting this course on hold in preparation for another opportunity; will pick up development from lesson 4 in about a month

16 July 2014:
- Added code for lesson 3
- The Java version of the course project uses Objectify; this Python version uses endpoints_proto_datastore for the same purpose
- App works fulfills all requirements
- Still working on how to unit test endpoints_proto_datastore objects, so unit tests don't work yet
